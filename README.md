# Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using a logistic regression model. The dataset contains various medical attributes that contribute to the prediction of heart disease.
## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Heart Disease UCI dataset. It contains 303 instances and 14 attributes, including:

- **age**: Age of the patient
- **sex**: Gender of the patient (1 = male; 0 = female)
- **cp**: Chest pain type (0-3)
- **trestbps**: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
- **chol**: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
- **fbs**: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
- **restecg**: Resting electrocardiographic results (0-2)
- **thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved
- **exang**: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
- **oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- **slope**: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0-2)
- **ca**: Number of major vessels (0-3)
- **thal**: Thalassemia (0-3)
- **target**: Diagnosis of heart disease (1 = presence; 0 = absence)
